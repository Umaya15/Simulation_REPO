          Welcome to Relativity Simulations, an immersive and thorough
          scientific platform that allows you to investigates or begin learning
          the principles of relativity. Relativity is a revolutionary branch and
          pillar of modern physics developed from the work of Henri Poincare,
          Hendrik Lorentz, Carl Schwarzschild, the Michelson-Morley experiment,
          and most notably Albert Einstein. The theory of special relativity,
          based on the invariance of the speed of light for all moving objects
          (‘frames of reference’) was the first, published in 1915.

          Relativity has continued streams of advancement in scientific fields,
          seen in the work of Max Planck, Georges Lemaitre, Richard Feynman and
          Stephen Hawking. The basis for the relativity theories came from
          Galileo’s observations of velocity and Newton’s observations of
          gravity.
